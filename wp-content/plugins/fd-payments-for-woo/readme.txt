== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I obtain a First Data Payeezy gateway and merchant account? =

[Click Here](http://www.cardpaysolutions.com/woocommerce?pid=83cf9aa647bc5b4e) to register for a low cost account.

= How do I get my Merchant Token? =

Call sales support at (866) 502-8910 and we can assist you.

= How do I test the plugin before going live? =

The plugin has a built-in test mode. Navigate to the configuration page at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout -> First Data Payeezy
and check the "Use Sandbox" box and then click the "Save Changes" button. The Merchant Token field is
not required in sandbox mode and can be left blank.

The following test cards can be used in Sandbox Mode with any future expiration date:

* Visa 4111111111111111
* MasterCard 5424180279791732
* American Express 373953192351004
* Discover 6510000000001248

= Can I use the plugin without the stored credit card features? =

Yes. Navigate to the configuration page at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout -> First Data Payeezy and uncheck the "Allow Stored Cards"
box and save your changes. Customers will then not see the option to save cards for future use in the checkout and will not see any stored credit
card information on the My Account page.

= What is the difference between the "Authorize Only" and "Authorize & Capture" transaction types? =

The Authorize Only transaction type reserves the amount of the transaction on the customer's credit card but does not start the process of
transferring the funds to your bank account until a separate "Capture" request is sent to the gateway. The capture request can be 
automatically sent when the order status is changed to "Completed" by enabling the "Auto Capture" feature in the configuration or by
logging into your Payeezy gateway account and manually requesting the capture from there.

The Authorize & Capture transaction type authorizes the transaction and then automatically captures it at your designated batch cut-off
time each day. This starts the process of moving the funds to your bank account.

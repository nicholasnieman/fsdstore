Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packing materials is included in the billable weight for the shipment. 
If you are unable to reconcile the differences call your local Worldwide Express office for assistance.

= Why do I sometimes get a message that a shipping rate estimate couldn’t be provided? =

There are several possibilities:

* UPS has restrictions on a shipment’s maximum weight, length and girth which your shipment may have exceeded.

* The Worldwide Express web service isn’t operational.
* Your Worldwide Express account has been suspended or cancelled.
* Your Eniture Technology license key for this plugin has expired.
